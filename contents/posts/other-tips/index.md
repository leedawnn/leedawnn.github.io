## How to change the favicon?

The favicon is located in `static/favicon.png`. If you replace that image, the favicon will change.

If you want to change the name of the favicon, change the `icon` property of `gatsby-plugin-manifest` in `gatsby-config.js`.

## Utterance is not working properly.

In the http environment, utterance may not work properly. Host your blog with https.
